# EX-NO14-HASH-ALGORITHM

## AIM:
To implementÂ HASH ALGORITHM

## ALGORITHM:

1. Hash Algorithm is used to convert input data (message) into a fixed-size string, typically a hash value, which uniquely represents the original data.

2. Initialization:
   - Choose a hash function \( H \) (e.g., SHA-256, MD5, etc.).
   - The message \( M \) to be hashed is input.

3. Message Preprocessing:
   - Break the message \( M \) into fixed-size blocks. If necessary, pad the message to make it compatible with the block size required by the hash function.
   - For example, in SHA-256, the message is padded to ensure that its length is a multiple of 512 bits.

4. Hash Calculation:
   - Process the message block by block, applying the hash function \( H \) iteratively to produce an intermediate hash value.
   - For SHA-256, each block is processed through a series of logical operations, bitwise manipulations, and modular additions.

5. Output:
   - After all blocks are processed, the final hash value (digest) is produced, which is a fixed-size output (e.g., 256-bit for SHA-256).
   - The resulting hash is unique to the input message, meaning even a small change in the message will result in a completely different hash.

6. Security: The strength of the hash algorithm lies in its collision resistance, ensuring that it is computationally infeasible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.


## Program:
~~~
#include <stdio.h>
 #include <string.h>
 void computeSimpleHash(const char *message, unsigned char *hash)
 {
 unsigned char temp = 0;
for (int i = 0; message[i] != '\0'; i++)
 {
 temp = temp ^ message[i];
 temp += message[i];
 }
 *hash = temp;
 }
 int main()
 {
 char message[256];
 unsigned char hash;
 char receivedHash[3];
 printf("Enter the message: ");
 scanf("%s", message);
 computeSimpleHash(message, &hash);
 printf("Computed Hash (in hex): %02x\n", hash);
 printf("Enter the received hash (in hex): ");
 scanf("%s", receivedHash);
 unsigned int receivedHashValue;
 sscanf(receivedHash, "%02x", &receivedHashValue);
 if (hash == receivedHashValue)
 {
 printf("Hash verification successful. Message is unchanged.\n");
 }
 else
 {
 printf("Hash verification failed. Message has been altered.\n");
 }
 return 0;
 }
